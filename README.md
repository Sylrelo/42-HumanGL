# HumanGL

##### This project is an introduction to hierarchical animation.

#### Instructions

- Any programming language

- Have a Makefile or an alternative (depending on the language)
- Any graphics library allowed
- Implement your own matrices functions, external libraries are forbidden
- Use OpenGL 4.0 minimum

#### Goals

Create a human-like model, with a head, torso, arms and legs. 

The body parts must move depending of his parent. For example, if the torso rotate, all the body parts attached must rotate with it.

Implement the following mandatory animation : walking, jumping, and idle.

Each body parts must be drawn with a single draw call and must the original geometry must be an 1x1x1 cube.

#### Possible bonuses

- More body parts
- More anymations
- Graphical interface to control individual body parts
